# Learn to Code

Each year [Oxford University CompSoc][compsoc] runs an introductory programming
course in Python. This repositories contains all of the code samples used in the
2017 course.

To run these code samples you will need [Python 3][python]. For the sessions we
recommend using IDLE, which will come pre-installed with Python. Alternatively
you can run the samples in a terminal via `python3 filename.py`.

Each folder contains some notes on what we did during the session, exercises,
and their solutions.
